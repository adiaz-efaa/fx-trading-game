# FX Trading Game

Text based game that simulates the mechanics of FX trading.

- There is a task running in the background that generates bod-offer prices for FX pair USDCLP (with almost no additional configuration, any FX pair could be simulated).
- There is an additional task in the background that manages buy and sell orders from the different players.
- Any player can issue a buy or sell order for a certain amount of USD at a certain price. For example, player A wants to BUY 1 MM USD at a price of 700.00 CLP/USD.
- In the previous example, if the ask price reaches a level greater than or equal to 700.00 the order will be fulfilled and player A's position will reflect the new trade.
- At any time time a player can check her/his position. The total PnL will also be displayed. This PnL can be thought of the player's score. The higher the PnL, the better the score.
